&emsp;â€ƒThis is the start of a series of posts where I will be recording notes on ideas and theorems as well as solving problems from Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective by Bryant and O'Hallaron (CS:APP3e). This is in concurrence with taking the online course this summer, found on this cs [**bible**](https://csdiy.wiki/en/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80/CSAPP/).
