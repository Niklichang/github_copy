This is the the daily run, which is the start of a larger plan to improve the individual holistically (another post will eventually cover this). My goal with this post is to update it every single day with what I ran, thoughts on the run, and other miscellaneous ideas. As long as this post has been updated recently below, it means that I have been consistent. Records can be accessed [here](https://www.strava.com/athletes/117513725).

**12/05/24, Day 4**: 3.17 mi, 1 mile threshold at 7:36. Not much to say today, and I honestly thought that I could do a bit better. I feel like 8:27 pace for 10k sounds a lot better than this. Only way to improve is to keep going.

<br/>

**12/04/24, Day 3**: 1.9 miles easy, 9:05/mi. A couple ideas came to me today. First of all, this run today is a testament to the detriments of procrastination. I had time this morning, yet I felt too lazy to get up to run. Come evening, I still had homework to do, and in the end didn't run until after 10pm. Not a good situation, especially if I'm in a situation at the end of the day where I can't run because I am out somewhere, and therefore a big waste of mental energy and time. Second, I mentioned before about the idea of no zero days. However, one can only greatly improve at something by spending time doing it. Therefore, it's a matter of perspective. If you go into something thinking that you just need to get a bit done consistently, will you make leaps and bounds? Probably not. Consistency is just a foolproof way to rack up time spent. However, the driven will enjoy the process and in turn greatly progress. Two sides of the same coin. Lastly, I was thinking of this idea of habits. Consistency is the basis of habits, and habits constitute change. But why is it so hard to form? Many people say that if you consistently do something for 2 weeks/1 month/X amount of time, it becomes natural. But the problem is, one can't dedicate so much time to something new everyday without considerable effort. Not only are you trying to form a new habit, this extra block of time needs to replace something else you have been doing before then. Some might say, yeah, there's so much time people waste daily on their phones, entertainment, etc. But this "waste" of time is a habit, too. It's just a bad habit. And so when people say a habit becomes natural after a certain amount of time, how many days have you spent building up a "wasteful" habit? It's hard to just drop that for something new, even if you know it is unproductive. Anyways, I hope no one else is running at 10pm.

**12/03/24**: 2.98 miles kind of tempo. Strava says 9:19/mi, and based off my recent 52:29 10k, which is 8 minutes 27 a mile, seems a little slow. I was breathing hard. Need to configure garmin watch that I have, so I can get more insight into data. Finals are coming up, so hopefully I can keep up the daily run. Seems to me that there is just so much time in the day in which I can be more productive, yet it's tough to change out of bad habits, like being on the phone or youtube. I have to say this log is partially in inspiration of Brock Kelly's (youtuber) the daily mile. Also, building on top of that, habits don't need to be so black and white. Believe that, in this case, I have to go out and run a certain distance every day seems to only put more inertia on habits your are trying to build. I read a great [blog post](https://knhash.in/streaks-ratios-not-absolutes/) in which the author described an idea of no zero days. "Not to look at streaks as a binary sequence of 0s and 1s, but as a sequence of floating point values." I don't feel like running X miles today. Try just running 1. I don't feel like running in general. Maybe just take a walk outside. Just avoid staying at zero. And in the end, what you are trying to achieve is consistency of effort, not the perfect streak of runs.

**12/02/24**: 2.3 miles easy pace. Simple run today, the point of it is to be consistent. No focus on structure or pacing, just running. Been out for many weeks, so I just need to be back on my feet building mileage. Excited to get back into running, especially since now I want to focus more time doing actual research in building a training plan.
