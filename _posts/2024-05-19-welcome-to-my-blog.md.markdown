&emsp;Welcome to my blog, where I post things related to my course work or interests. Some areas I am interested in are machine learning and computer systems. 

&emsp;It is currently 7:00am in the morning, and since earlier in the night I was awake in bed wondering why I couldn't sleep. I had a normal day, a normal week, warranting what I thought would be regular sleep for the night. However, I feel wide awake, anxious, a tightness across my chest. Ultimately, one of two goals I have set up for myself since uni was to get an internship, and the end of May 2024 is fast approaching without one. With every passing week, I feel that this challenge has affected me mentally due to my own beliefs more than anything else. However, there comes a time where one must be held accountable for what they do and want to become. If I am interested in ML and systems, why have I went through courses on probability, statistics, digital design, without focusing on learning and building fundamentals?

&emsp;Recently, I heard something from someone I look up to: "Do everything with the future in mind." Sometimes I feel as if it is unapproachable, that I can't even sit down and do in the present.

&emsp;I hope this sheds light on the motivation behind the creation of this blog. I need to hold myself accountable for the goals that I am trying to achieve, and this is a step in the process for my future self.
